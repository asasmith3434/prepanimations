    <h1><u>Animations</u></h1>
</p>
      In order for Dr. B to create those cool looking animations between his graphs the .transition() javascript was used. This
      method is used to create a transition from one graph to another, so that it's more appealing to the audience. Moreover, 
      .duration() can be used to give the animation a certain amount of time to complete the animation, which Dr. B must have used
      to manage the duration of the animation between the various graphs. Furthermore, there was a presence of mouse over on the 
      graphs presented to the class, where whenever a set a data was hovered over it would display that students data in the class.
      However, when the hovered items would change color that can also be done within css and not javascript.
